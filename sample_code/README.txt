adctodac_notiming:
-Demonstrates how to setup ADC and DAC
-No timing files have been copied and timing is quite arbitrary in this case
-It is a good demonstration of using the DAC to simply output a value
-This will be a good reference when writing ADC and receiver and wanting to test it

dac_dma:
-Demonstrates how to use the DMA with a DAC
-Not very built up just the very basics
